# CG1111-Color-and-Sound-Sensing-Robot-
This was a Group Project for our introduction to engineering principles module. It consisted of an of an exiting robot that functioned on an arduino board 
and had a couple of sensors that we were able to mount onto the robot for colour detection, trail following and obstacle detection (ultrasonic and IR sensors).
It had a low-pass and band -pass filter connected to it so that it could detect sound of varying frequency ranges and consisted of a speaker for playing 
different types of songs for different scenarios it encountered.
